This was one of the first homework assignments that I completed as a student in the University of Texas Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I must admit that at first it wasn't easy. Actually, it still isn't easy!! Every day I am astonished about how much there is to learn in this world of coding. You may be wondering what compelled me to invest in such a massive endeavor. With a background in environmental sciences and numurous successful years of protecting our natural resources I have become motivated to try something new and unknown. Right now, web development is what drives and energizes my intellectual curiousity. The prospect of shifting into a career that will likely enable me to exercise more creativity, collaboration and propell me into an ever changing world of technology is highly attractive. 
                                            <p>As a full stack web developer, I like to focus on functionality, aesthetics and a user-friendly experience. By employing JavaSript, jQuery, Node.js, HTML5 and CSS in the development of applications, I have experience that I am proud to showcase. As a dependable team member that emphasizes collaboration, effective communication and keeping a project on task, I believe that I can make an impactful contribution anywhere. I aim to work for a company that strives to produce meaningful applications while empowering their developers to tap into their full creative potential. With five plus years working for the public in the Environmental Compliance industry and a proven track record of growth, I know that I have the grit and determination to launch a new and exciting career in web development.</p>
                                            <p>Thank you for taking the time to navigate and explore my portfolio. If you have any questions, comments or ideas please feel free to contact me. I am happy to connect and welcome collaboration. Cheers!</p>
